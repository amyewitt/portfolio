I then went in depth researching Box, GoogleDrive and Evernote; analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT Analysis) of each.  From my research of competitors, I identified ways my product could differentiate itself.

		    			</h4>
		    			<p>
		    				Now that I figured out my usersâ€™ needs, motivation and potientional pain points, I could start designing what solutions my product could offer.  I created user stories to prioritize which features would be important must-haves and which features might be added on later, perhaps as part of a paid subscription. Here are the highest priority user stories whose processes I needed to think through:
		    			</p>
		    			<ul>
		    				<li>I want to add content to my dashboard</li>
		    				<li>I want to organize conent within my dashboard</li>

		    			<h4>

		    			</h4>
		    			<p>
		    				As I moved through the process, the direction for my product became more clear and I began to build a brand that represented the product accurately. I began by mind mapping and sketching names and logos that communicated one of the most important and differentiating features - simple task management within a document, meant to make collaboration easier and more productive.<br></br>

  				</h4> <!-- /.section-title -->
  				<p>
  					CheckBox was my first comprehensive project as a designer and through this project, I learned a lot about my own process.</p>

  					<ul>
  						<li><strong>Listen to users.</strong> Focusing my design on user needs rather than my own assumptions is critical. I am building products for other people to use and it was important for me to listen carefully to what users were telling me along the way. </li>
  						<li><strong>Begin with a minimum viable product.</strong> The potential features for a product such as this one are vast and starting with a baseline helped me both stay focused on what users were asking for, rather than creating a replica of a competitorâ€™s product.</li>
  						<li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Creating a project that can compete in an already saturated space was intimidating at first. I wondered how I could differentiate myself from well known comprehensive competitors - the answer was a simplified design that worked on developing features users were asking for. By making task assignment the cornerstone of CheckBox I was able to differentiate my product to meet the needs of a particular audience.</li>
  						<li><strong>There is more work to do.</strong> I created a collaborative solution for individuals and small groups planning events - tracking the tasks of a major work project would be better done in a more robust task management platform. My next moves with CheckBox would be to build a â€˜projectâ€™ option to allow my product to compete with task management platforms such as Asana, Trello, Lira, etc. I met the goal of this iteration, but perfecting this project is a continuous process.</li>
  						<li><strong>I can do this.</strong> I have the ability to create a product that users are asking for and they want. Users were able to complete the actions I requested of them and were able to name how this product could be used in their lives.</li>
