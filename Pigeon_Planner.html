The goal of the survey was to identify the major barriers that prevent students from completing homework and determine where to focus my design, I received 99 responses. Results of the survey are highlighted below.

		    					<p>Survey Takeaways</p>
									<li>Google Classroom is the most used assignment management tool</li>
									<li>Google classroom is optimized for the web (internet required)</li>
									<li>Google Classroom can be overwhelming and saturated with material</li>
									<li>All but one student in the survey have a cellphone</li>
									<li>“Struggling with Time Management” is cited as the main reason why students don’t complete homework</li>
									<li>45% of students surveyed complete less than 75% of homework </li>
									<li>Ways to increase homework completion (in order of % answered):</li>
									<ul class="list_within">
											<li>Shorter assignments (72.4%)</li>
											<li>An estimate time it will take to complete assignments (28%)</li>
											<li>After school session to complete homework (27.3%)</li>

  					Takeaways
  					<br></br>
  				</h4>
  				<p>
  					CheckBox was my first comprehensive project as a designer and through this project, I learned a lot about my own process.</p>

  					<ul>
  						<li><strong>Listen to users.</strong> Focusing my design on user needs rather than my own assumptions is critical. I am building products for other people to use and it was important for me to listen carefully to what users were telling me along the way. </li>
  						<li><strong>Begin with a minimum viable product.</strong> The potential features for a product such as this one are vast and starting with a baseline helped me both stay focused on what users were asking for, rather than creating a replica of a competitor’s product.</li>
  						<li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Creating a project that can compete in an already saturated space was intimidating at first. I wondered how I could differentiate myself from well known comprehensive competitors - the answer was a simplified design that worked on developing features users were asking for. By making task assignment the cornerstone of CheckBox I was able to differentiate my product to meet the needs of a particular audience.</li>
  						<li><strong>There is more work to do.</strong> I created a collaborative solution for individuals and small groups planning events - tracking the tasks of a major work project would be better done in a more robust task management platform. My next moves with CheckBox would be to build a ‘project’ option to allow my product to compete with task management platforms such as Asana, Trello, Lira, etc. I met the goal of this iteration, but perfecting this project is a continuous process.</li>
  						<li><strong>I can do this.</strong> I have the ability to create a product that users are asking for and they want. Users were able to complete the actions I requested of them and were able to name how this product could be used in their lives.</li>
